			<h2> <span class= "hi"> Hey,</span> I'm Jennifer! </h2>
			<p>
				I've always had a passion for technology and the positive impact it can have on businesses and communities. As an inaugural class member of the Masters of Management in Artificial Intelligence program at Queen's University, the first degree of its kind, and the Toronto Lead for Canada Learning Code, I'm immersed in all things STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). My passion has been refined via strategic roles at leading global organization's including ABInBev, Uber, Pepsico, along with internships at JP Morgan and the U.S. Department of Commerce, where I operated at the intersection of technology, finance and consumer behaviour.
			</p>
			<p>
				I was born in Europe, grew up in Africa, and attended school and began my career in Canada and the United States. I believe technology is universal and look at opportunities through a global lens. Outside of my educational and professional pursuits, you can find me sailing or going for a run along the waterfront.
